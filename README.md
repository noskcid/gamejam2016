# GAMEJAM 2016 :joy:
Repo for the 2016 Gamejam.

## Set it up
Clone this repository into local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/noskcid/gamejam2016.git`

## Running the game locally
The easiest way is if you have python installed. Load up a command line/terminal, CD to the root of the repository and use the following command to start a basic webserver.

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

The game can then be accessed through your webserver (IE6 preferably) at the following address:

`http://localhost:8000`
